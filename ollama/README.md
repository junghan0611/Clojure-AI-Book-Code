# Using the OpenAI, Anthropic, Mistral, and Local Hugging Face Large Language Model APIs in Racket

A Clojure library for using the Ollama LLM APIs

You need to install Ollama on your system: https://ollama.ai

You then need to install the Mistral model (this takes a while the first time, but the model file is cached so future startups are fast):

    ollama run mistral


## Usage

In one console, run the Ollama REST API service:

    ollama serve

Then run the tests in another window:

    lein test
